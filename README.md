licenseplate-checker HW from TOPDesk

# Versions:
java: openjdk 11.0.17 2022-10-18

os: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

maven: Apache Maven 3.6.3

# Commands:
```
mvn clean test
```

# Remarks:
HW was fairly simple, I used regex to validate license plate string

On a related note, at my previous employment I had developed 
Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), ML based solution which extracts license-plates
from videos or images with high accuracy
